    <h2>To my Sayang ðŸ’œ</h2>
    <p>
      mohd hafiz saya. i know this distance is hurting us. being away from each other is making us weaker day by day. everything doesn't seem right when the presence of the other person is not there. its feel lonely eventho we are mostly still on call with each other. u asked me is it bad thing that u feel weak when ur not with me, rather than calling u weak its definitely okay to feel things. its just show how changed u are rn. how our love changed us. its not a bad thing sayang. its something we both are going through together. dont feel guilty to tell me how u felt, tell me whenever u felt sad sayang, just tell me. i want to be someone u go back to every single times. i dont ever want you to show this side of u to other ppl. i am that selfish. its hurt us to wait for our next meet, i know sayang. from the good side, it gave us reason to take care of ourselves more so that we met each other again in our best condition. im worried of u sayang. i love that u miss me so much cause i also have been missing u like crazy. i looked at our albums countless times dah. i love that but i dont want u to be distracted from ur work and ur environment hafiz. i dont want anything bad happened to u, the thought of something bad happened to u scares me so much. i want to marry u so u need to live long laaaa. as for u asking me to wait for u and for us, sayang saya hafiz comel saya , awak takyah tanya pun saya mmg akan tunggu awak. i cant imagine my future without u in it. everything in my life revolves around u now and im loving it. i promise u to always speak up whenever things doesnt feel good to me. i promise u to always try to fix our problems together. i promise u to never run away without any words spoken. i promise to try for us sayang. u changed me, to a better person. i used to have avoidant issues which i always just run away from my issues and come back pretending nothing happened. but now id try to talk my feelings out to u bcs ur the one who encouraged me to do so. u gave me reassurance that u will hear me out and listen to what i said and u really did sayang. im so grateful to have u in my life. every part of u is lovable, ur clingy side , ur childish side, ur nerdy side, even when ur mad abt something its still lovable as i know u also tak suka marah like that, i love the loverboy u are. when u express yourself, your feelings, everything in ur mind, i love to hear it sayang. ill never get bored of it as its will always remind me that im loving two versions of u which is hafiz saya and his inner child. always be my baby, never change sayang. i love you as u are, i love you so much. baby saya ill wait for the day u put on a ring on my finger. im so happy when u talk abt our future to me. its just show how much u take our relationship seriously and i love it. sayang, if my way of showing love to u is lacking pls do tell me. im bad with words even in text im still bad at expressing myself. but i hope u know that i love you so much i wanna be with u all the time and i want to build a family together with you. ur the only person i long for and i never want to lose you. how pitch black my life will be if ur not with me. mohd hafiz, saya sayang awak. sayang awak sangatÂ sangat
